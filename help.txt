ideal-pancake

A CLI tool for text analysis

Usage:

ideal-pancake </path/to/file> [-d] [/path/to/dictionary]

Where file is the text file you would like to analyze, and dictionary is your dictionary file.
file can contain any ASCII text, but dictionary must be a list of words, separated by whitespaces.
If dictionary mode is enabled, a dictionary is required. Dictionary mode allows access to better word analysis functions, but it requires a dictionary file.

-d     Enable dictionary mode.

-h     View this text
